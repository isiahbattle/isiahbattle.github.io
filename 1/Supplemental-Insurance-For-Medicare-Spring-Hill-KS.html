The plans also provide extra benefits which might be popular with the elderly, together with fitness center memberships and eyeglasses and often are cheaper than commonplace Medicare. Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays a hundred% of medical providers for the remainder of the calendar 12 months. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another downside with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage.
