<p>A rebate cannot contribute to "revenue" ("profit" is in quotes as a result of most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-profit organizations, primarily integrated health supply systems). In 2017, the typical out-of-pocket restrict for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the identical as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $four,313 in 2011 . HMO enrollees have generally had decrease out-of-pocket limits than enrollees in native PPOs or regional PPOs, and this stays the case in 2017. More than half of all enrollees (52%) are in plans with limits above $5,000 in 2017, much like 2016.<p>
<p>That is why having selection between forms of Medicare and many selections within Part C is so necessary.
