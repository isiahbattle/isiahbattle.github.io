<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
