<p>I would suggest addressing that concern with a union consultant and going from there. Some people choose to pay for health coverage by way of an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a selection then that’s one thing to first address with the entity that’s forcing you to acquire Medicare.<p>
<p>You don’t need to enroll when you automatically get Part A and Part B. You'll getyour pink, white, and blue Medicare cardin the mail three months before your 65th birthday. Most people ought to enroll in Part A when they flip sixty five, but certain folks could choose to delay Part B.Find out more about whether or not you should take Part B.

<p>Whether you even have coverage by way of your employer has no bearing on whether or not you’ll pay a premium for Medicare. You can qualify for particular enrollment if the plan has fewer than 20 employees; Medicare might be major vs. secondary to the group health plan based mostly on the number of employees, though.
