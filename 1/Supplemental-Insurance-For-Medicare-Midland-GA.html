After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 percent of the price of medicine. Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the flexibleness to range the cost-sharing design of their Part D benefit; nevertheless, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible can't exceed $400. Additionally, as beforehand discussed, premiums differ across plan types and enrollment by plan sort varies across states.
