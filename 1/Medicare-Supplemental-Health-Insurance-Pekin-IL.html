<p>The common premium for Medicare Advantage plans with built-in Part D coverage is about $36/month in 2020. Across all Medicare Advantage plans, the common premium in 2020 is about $23/month, and is expected to decrease to $21/month in 2021.

A Medicare Advantage plan will wrap your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage into one plan.<p>
