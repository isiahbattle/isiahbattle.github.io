<p>I would suggest addressing that problem with a union consultant and going from there. Some folks choose to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a selection then that’s one thing to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>

This common includes zero-premium plans and Medicare Advantage plans that don’t include Part D coverage — if we solely take a look at plans that do have premiums and that do embrace Part D coverage, the typical premium is about $36/month.<p>
