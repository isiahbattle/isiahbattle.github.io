<p>However, home companions (identical-gender and opposite-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are suggested to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.

<p>Most Americans start amassing social security as quickly as they will.
