Prior authorization is most often required for relatively costly companies, such as inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but occasionally required for preventive services. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can even require enrollees to make use of “step therapy” for Part B medication, that means that they're required to attempt some specific medication before they obtain approval to try other drugs. In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare does not usually require prior authorization for providers, and doesn't require step therapy for Part B medication.<p>
