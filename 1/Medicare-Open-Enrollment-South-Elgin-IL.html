Medigap plans, like Medicare Advantage plans, are provided through private insurance companies, and can be found for purchase by way of brokers like eHealth Insurance Services, Inc. The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period runs from January 1 to March 31. Many beneficiaries are automatically eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for example, those that have worked or spouses have worked a minimum of 10 years, or forty quarters, and paid Medicare taxes via their employment.

<p>Advantage plans provide extra coverage like hearing companies, prescription drug coverage, dental companies, and imaginative and prescient care. Medicare Advantage plans may prevent money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to buy a separate Part D plan if you'd like that coverage. Also check the price of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits of their coverage. If further benefits are included, such as help with listening to aids and dental bills, make sure to learn the way much of these bills will really be lined.<p>
<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant when you did not join Medicare Part B when you were first eligible.

Despite having a lot of low and $0 monthly premium plans, many Cigna plans nonetheless offer aggressive benefits and even prescription drug coverage.<p>
<p>For instance, if you waited for three years to enroll, your penalty might be 30% of the premium. In this instance, you would possibly pay your Part B monthly premium, plus 30%, for so long as you have Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you'll need to join it if you first become eligible to do so.<p>
