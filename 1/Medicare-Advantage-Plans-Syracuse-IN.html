<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Is the 6 month retroactive interval for medicare from the day medicare coverage starts or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I actually have to stop HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months back from date coverage starts.<p>
