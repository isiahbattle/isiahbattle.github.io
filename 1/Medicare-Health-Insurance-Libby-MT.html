<p>You received’t should pay more money for your health care when you hit your yearly restrict. Original Medicare has no limitations on how much you pay for your care.

<p>However, domestic companions (same-gender and opposite-gender) are usually not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties.
