For example, if you waited for a 12 months to enroll in Part A, you would pay the 10% penalty for two years.<p>
<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five have to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not.
