<p>Medicare Advantage plans cover all of the original benefits you obtain under Original Medicare with the exception of hospice care. Medicare solely pays for a sure number of days in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility.Has an out-of-pocket most every year. Our plans cover emergency care with a $50,000 lifetime most.

<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months if you enroll while you still have employer-sponsored coverage or within one month after that coverage ends.
