You don’t have to join Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
