<p>When you file in your personal retirement benefit, you'll obtain an additional fee roughly equal to the quantity by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit. Social Security might call this complete amount your retirement benefit, however we predict that’s misleading.

<p>Be certain to think about how you may pay for the issues Medicare doesn't cover. For occasion, it usually does not cover dental work and routine vision or hearing care. Same goes for long-term care, cosmetic procedures and — for the jet-setters — medical care overseas. "About a month or two earlier than you flip 65, you will be routinely enrolled, and your card will simply present up in the mail," Roberts said.<p>
