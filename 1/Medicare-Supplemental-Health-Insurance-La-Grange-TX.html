<p>In basic, when you’re enrolled in Medicare, you don’t have to take motion to renew your coverage every year. This is true whether or not you might be in Original Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan, or a Medicare prescription drug plan. As lengthy as you proceed to pay any necessary premiums, your Medicare coverage should automatically renew every year with a number of exceptions as described under. Your health insurance could also be lined by a group medical insurance plan through your employer. You can enroll in Medicare at any time should you lose your group insurance.<p>

How do they verify whether you've or didn’t have a bunch health plan?<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to maintain it when you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment period that lasts eight months. Though you don’t must enroll in Medicare at age 65 in case you have coverage through a qualified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>
