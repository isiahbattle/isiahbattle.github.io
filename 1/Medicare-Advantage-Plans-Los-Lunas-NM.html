<p>Get your needs in order relating to healthcare, ongoing finances, and your estate. The first step is to think about your decisions and get your whole medical and private files organized. Age sixty six is now considered Social Security’s “full retirement age,” which means the age when you can claim your full retirement benefits without penalty. Some begin to claim reduced benefits at age 62, whereas others wait until after full retirement age to assert larger benefits.
