<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>When you enroll, you’ll be requested if you want to join Parts A and B, or Part A solely. You’ll then be asked to call your employer, confirm that you have health insurance through that employer, and point out how lengthy you’ve been working there. If you could have group health coverage through an employer with 20 or more people, that insurance is your major and Medicare is your secondary. I can’t tell you when to enroll in Social Security, however I can tell you there are benefits to waiting. You can delay benefits all the way in which till age 70 and hold boosting them within the process.<p>
