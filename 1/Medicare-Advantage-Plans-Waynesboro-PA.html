<p>I would suggest addressing that problem with a union representative and going from there. Some individuals select to pay for health coverage via an employer plus Medicare. If you’re not being given a choice then that’s something to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>
<p>Most Americans begin collecting social security as quickly as they'll. And while that is fine should you don’t have a choice, when you can, holding off for a couple of years will allow you a much bigger payout later.
