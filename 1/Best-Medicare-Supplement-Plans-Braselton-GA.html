That is, under Part C plans, there's a limit on how much a beneficiary should spend yearly OOP. Medicare pays a fixed amount for your care each month to the companies providing Medicare Advantage Plans. In most states, the vast majority of enrollees are in HMOs; nonetheless, in 12 states , nearly all of enrollees are in native PPOs .<p>
<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not.
