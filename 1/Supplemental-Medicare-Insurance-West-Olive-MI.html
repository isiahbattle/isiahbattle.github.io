<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
