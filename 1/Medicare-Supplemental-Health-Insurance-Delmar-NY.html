<p>In 28 states and Puerto Rico, at least 31 p.c of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, with more than forty % of enrollees in six states and Puerto Rico. Medicare Advantage enrollment is relatively low in 14 states and the District of Columbia, including two largely rural states where it is nearly non-existent .

<p>It will also be necessary to know the implications for beneficiaries in both Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare, by way of costs, benefits, premiums, quality of care, patient outcomes, and access to suppliers. After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 % of the cost of medicine. Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the pliability to range the fee-sharing design of their Part D benefit; however, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible can not exceed $four hundred.
