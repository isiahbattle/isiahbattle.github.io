<p>Medicare Part A supplies FFS payments for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and skilled nursing providers if an individual is first admitted inpatient for three days. Less typically, listening to and wellness benefits not present in Medicare Part B are included in a Medicare Advantage or different Part C plan. As of 2019, many further non Part B companies were added to public Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans.
