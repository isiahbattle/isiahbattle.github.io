You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
