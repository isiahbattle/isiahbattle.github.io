If you’re not being given a choice then that’s one thing to first tackle with the entity that’s forcing you to obtain Medicare.<p>

If you select to have Original Medicare coverage, you can buy a Medicare Supplement Insurance policy from a private insurance company. Medicare is our nation's health insurance program for folks age sixty five or older.<p>
