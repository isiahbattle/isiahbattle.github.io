When very small employers join along with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide primary coverage so long as no less than one of the employers has 20+ workers. But employers can also ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll should check along with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.
