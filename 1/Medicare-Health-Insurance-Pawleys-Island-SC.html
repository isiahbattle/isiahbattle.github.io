<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
