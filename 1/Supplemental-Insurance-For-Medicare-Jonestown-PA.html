Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays a hundred% of medical companies for the rest of the calendar 12 months. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another downside with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage.
