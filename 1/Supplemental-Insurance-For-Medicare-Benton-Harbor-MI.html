This is the lowest that the average month-to-month premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007 proper after the second 12 months of the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process.<p>
<p>Part B benefits cover certain non-hospital medical expenses like medical doctors’ office visits, blood checks, X-rays, diabetic screenings and provides, and outpatient hospital care.
