<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Since 2017, the typical month-to-month Medicare Advantage premium has decreased by an estimated 34.2 percent. This is the bottom that the average monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007.<p>
