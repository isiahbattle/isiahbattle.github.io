If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Call or go to the web site of your State Health Insurance Assistance Program . Your native SHIP can help you understand your Medicare coverage options and navigate any changes. If you could have Original Medicare, take a look at next year’s Medicare & You handbook to know your Medicare costs and benefits for the upcoming yr.<p>

<p>When speaking to the corporate they repeated that however didn’t say what communication they were speaking about. I can’t discover something on their website and earlier than I spend an hour on hold with SSA I thought I would ask you. Hi Marcia, Both you and your husband should contemplate enrolling for Medicare Part B proper when he retires. You are taking a risk delaying Part B because as soon as he retires Medicare is his main insurance, whatever the variety of staff at his agency and whether or not you’re actually enrolled.<p>
