Medicare MSA Plans mix a excessive deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a trust or custodial savings account (as defined and/or approved by the IRS).<p>
<p>However, home companions (similar-gender and reverse-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B without incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months before turning age sixty five to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The guidelines are different for workers and retirees; so to be sure you enroll properly, avoid Medicare premium penalties and understand how Medicare works with your UC-sponsored medical plan, follow these steps.
