<p>Plan F was probably the most comprehensive plan at that point, but it’s no longer available to people who are newly-eligible for Medicare. Medicare Part A covers 100% of the price of expert nursing facility care for the first 20 days, as long as you had no less than a 3-night time inpatient hospital keep previous to the skilled nursing facility keep. After the first 20 days, your skilled nursing facility coinsurance in 2021 is projected to be $181.50 per day for days (after that, Medicare not covers expert nursing facility expenses, so you’ll pay the total cost).
