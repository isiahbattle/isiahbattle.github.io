<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>If you do not have Medicare or you need to join Part A , contactSocial Security. Your plan leaves the Medicare program in the middle of the 12 months. There are deadlines for enrolling in several components of Medicare. We explain these deadlines and the penalties you could accrue if you miss them.<p>
