<p>However, domestic companions (identical-gender and opposite-gender) are normally not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The rules are totally different for workers and retirees; so to make sure you enroll properly, keep away from Medicare premium penalties and understand how Medicare works along with your UC-sponsored medical plan, follow these steps. If you do not make any changes throughout AEP, your present plan will mechanically renew the following year.
