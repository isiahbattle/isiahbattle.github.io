<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time through the yr. The Special Enrollment Period lets you change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage outdoors of AEP because of sure qualifying occasions. Some plans, like Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug plans, ship information to members every fall that explains changes in the plan’s benefit coverage, costs, or service area for the subsequent plan year.

<p>If you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, most Medicare services are lined through the plan and aren’t paid for under Original Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans offer prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Advantage plans, the essential Medicare Part A and Part B benefits – besides hospice companies – are routinely covered. As of 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to cover a broader range of extra benefits, together with things like house health aides, medical transportation, and the set up of in-house safety devices.
