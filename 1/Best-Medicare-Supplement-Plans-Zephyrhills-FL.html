<p>In general, when you’re enrolled in Medicare, you don’t need to take motion to renew your coverage every year. This is true whether or not you're in Original Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan, or a Medicare prescription drug plan. As long as you continue to pay any essential premiums, your Medicare coverage ought to routinely renew yearly with a few exceptions as described below. Your health insurance could also be lined by a group medical insurance plan by way of your employer. You can enroll in Medicare at any time when you lose your group insurance.<p>
<p>Starting Medicare Part B on the proper time can help guarantee that you have robust health coverage on the lowest cost to you. Medicare Part B isn’t a authorized requirement, and also you don’t need it in some conditions.

If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you stop working, keep in mind that this doesn’t depend as coverage based mostly on current employment; make sure you don’t wait until your COBRA benefits end to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>

<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to keep it when you join. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage via a certified group health plan, doing so would possibly make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>
