If you enroll throughout your birthday month or one of the three following months, your coverage efficient date will be delayed. The UC-sponsored medical plans coordinate Medicare Part D coverage with the plan’s coverage. Most people are not charged a premium for Part D. However, as with Part B, you could pay a Part D premium based on your income.<p>
<p>You and your partner pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits beneath Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D when you sign up for it. If one or each of you choose to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you will proceed to pay separately the Medicare Part B premium and presumably a separate plan premium. For instance, you might resolve to stick with Original Medicare, and sign up for a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.<p>

<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B throughout your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to attend till the following General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 every year.

<p>The quantity you pay for Part D deductibles, copayments, and/or coinsurance varies by plan.
