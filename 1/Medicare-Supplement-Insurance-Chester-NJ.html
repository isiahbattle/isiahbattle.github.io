<p>It may even be necessary to grasp the implications for beneficiaries in each Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare, in terms of prices, benefits, premiums, high quality of care, affected person outcomes, and access to providers. After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 p.c of the cost of medication. Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the flexibleness to range the cost-sharing design of their Part D benefit; however, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible cannot exceed $four hundred. Additionally, as previously mentioned, premiums differ across plan sorts and enrollment by plan type varies across states.
