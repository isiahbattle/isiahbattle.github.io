Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays a hundred% of medical services for the remainder of the calendar 12 months. That safety has no lifetime maximum, one other drawback with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP restrict doesn't apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
