About 7% of Medicare's 61 million or so beneficiaries pays extra as a result of these income-adjusted quantities .<p>
<p>If you enroll in Medicare during the January – March General Enrollment period, you'll be able to enroll in Part D between April 1 and June 30. But Medicare Part B has a monthly premium — projected to be about $153.30/month in 2021 — which will be deducted out of your Social Security or Railroad Retirement check.

Same goes for lengthy-time period care, cosmetic procedures and — for the jet-setters — medical care overseas.
