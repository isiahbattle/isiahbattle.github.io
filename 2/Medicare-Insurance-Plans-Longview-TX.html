The Medicare Advantage common month-to-month premium would be the lowest in 14 years for the over 26 million Medicare beneficiaries projected to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan for 2021. Additionally, for the primary time, seniors who use insulin may have over 1,600 Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans to select from that can offer insulin at not more than a $35 month-to-month copay starting in January.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw back” the amount it paid for your care when it finds out. At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, but would possibly not qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for more than 8 months. If you’re happy along with your current Medicare plan, you don’t need to take any action. However, plan details can change annually, so you could wish to compare your plan options for each to confirm your health and prescription drug needs are coated by your plan for the subsequent year. This interval is also referred to as Fall Medicare Open Enrollment and the Annual Election Period .<p>
