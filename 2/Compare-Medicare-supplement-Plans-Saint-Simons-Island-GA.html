Original Medicare contains Part A and Part B. Part A covers inpatient hospital companies, skilled nursing care facility expenses and hospice care.

After the first 20 days, your skilled nursing facility coinsurance in 2021 is projected to be $181.50 per day for days (after that, Medicare not covers expert nursing facility charges, so you’ll pay the complete cost). The expert nursing facility coinsurance is $176 per day in 2020. No premium – for most beneficiaries who paid into Medicare through payroll taxes.<p>
<p>Most Medigap plans additionally cover a minimum of a portion of skilled nursing facility coinsurance costs. If you’re already receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board benefits and you’re a U.S. resident, the federal government mechanically enrolls you in both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B at age 65.<p>
