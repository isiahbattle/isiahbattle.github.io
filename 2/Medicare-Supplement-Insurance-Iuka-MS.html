<h3>Medicare Part C And D Iuka Mississippi 38852</h3>
<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Hi Karen, if you enroll in Medicare Part A, you will be penalized for persevering with to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take effect back to the date you certified for Medicare .<p>
