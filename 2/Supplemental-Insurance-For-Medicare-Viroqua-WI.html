That mentioned, it usually pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even if you have health coverage already. It gained’t cost you something, and this fashion, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and potentially pick up the tab for something your primary insurance doesn’t cover. If you don't join Part B if you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not.

<p>Obviously whoever wrote the article doesn’t understand the US Healthcare industry. If you could have a excessive-deductible medical insurance policy, you’ll have to stop making HSA contributions when you enroll in Medicare.

Generally, if a person continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later during a SEP.
