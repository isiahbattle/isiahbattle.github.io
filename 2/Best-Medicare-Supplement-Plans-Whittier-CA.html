You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

If you've group health coverage via an employer with 20 or more folks, that insurance is your main and Medicare is your secondary.
