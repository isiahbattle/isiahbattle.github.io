<p>Yes, you can enroll in Medicare at sixty five and stop paying premiums on your present insurance. The six months of retroactive coverage applies if you join Medicare after age 65. At that time, whenever you enroll, your coverage dates again to either six months, or your sixty fifth birthday — whichever is shorter. It doesn’t matter in case your employer has 20 full-time or half-time employees; the edge is 20 to be thought of a gaggle health plan for Medicare special enrollment purposes.<p>
<p>You are free to take Part A and B, Part A only, or defer taking Medicare at all.
