<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare solely in the course of the Medicare general enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they can delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later throughout a SEP. For example, employer coverage for retirees or by way of COBRA doesn’t rely as current employment, so these individuals don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage enrollment has grown rapidly over the past decade, and Medicare Advantage plans have taken on a larger role within the Medicare program. This knowledge analysis offers current information and tendencies about Medicare Advantage enrollment, premiums, and out-of-pocket limits.<p>

Hi Karen, whenever you enroll in Medicare Part A, you will be penalized for continuing to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take effect again to the date you certified for Medicare .<p>
