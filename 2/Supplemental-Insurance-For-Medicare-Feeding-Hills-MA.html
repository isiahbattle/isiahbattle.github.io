If you decide to delay your Social Security retirement benefits or Railroad Retirement Benefits beyond age 65, there may be an choice to enroll in simply Medicare and apply for retirement benefits at a later time.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw back” the amount it paid on your care when it finds out.

As a result of these decisions, you might have differences in your Medicare benefits. There are four “elements” to the Medicare insurance program, each providing a certain set of Medicare benefits.<p>
