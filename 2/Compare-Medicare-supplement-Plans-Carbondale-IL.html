<p>Medicare Advantage plans typically incorporate additional benefits, together with Part D coverage and extras corresponding to dental and imaginative and prescient. And the plans do embody a cap on out-of-pocket costs that can’t exceed $6,700 in 2020 , which Original Medicare doesn't have.

Beneficiaries with diagnoses of ESRD typically incur larger costs than the common beneficiary, and CMS is making these changes to out-of-pocket maximums to better reflect beneficiary spending.<p>
