You may then need to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you might have had Part B and didn't enroll.

<h3>Medicare Cost Plan Fairhope Alabama 36532</h3>
<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it when you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment period that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage via a certified group health plan, doing so might make sense if that plan isn’t heavily backed by your employer.<p>
