<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>Medicare open enrollment – also known as Medicare’s annual election interval – runs from October 15 via December 7 annually. To keep your UC-sponsored coverage, you’ll need to pay your Medicare Part B premiums with out interruption and on time to take care of your Medicare enrollment. Depending on your earnings you may have to pay an extra premium for Part D as well. If you’ll turn sixty five within the subsequent calendar yr, it is time to make some choices.<p>
<p>If you keep the Medicare card, you retain Part B and will need to pay Part B premiums. If you signed up for Medicare via Social Security, then you'll need to contact them to drop Part B coverage. If your Medicare coverage has started and also you wish to drop Part B, contact Social Security for directions on tips on how to submit a signed request. Your coverage will finish the first day of the month after Social Security will get your request. If you are underneath 65 and receiving certain disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you will be routinely enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>
