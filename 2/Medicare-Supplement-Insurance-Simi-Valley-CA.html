<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
