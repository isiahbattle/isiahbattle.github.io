<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at 65 and presently have company supplied group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare?

<p>Generally you'll be able to enroll in Medicare solely during the Medicare general enrollment interval . Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later during a SEP.
