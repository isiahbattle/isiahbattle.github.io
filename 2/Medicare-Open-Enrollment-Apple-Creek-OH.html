You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Even if you are satisfied together with your current Medicare coverage, take a look at other Medicare options in your space that will higher fit your individual needs within the upcoming year. For instance, check to see if there is another plan in your area that will offer you higher health and/or drug coverage at a more inexpensive price.

<p>Consider plan costs, plan docs, comfort, your life-style and journey plans, your health, and any further benefits in making your Medicare coverage decisions.
