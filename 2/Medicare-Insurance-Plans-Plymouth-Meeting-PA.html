Since 2011, federal regulation has required Medicare Advantage plans to supply an out-of-pocket limit for companies lined under Parts A and B not to exceed $6,700 (in-network) or $10,000 (in-network and out-of-community combined). Beneficiaries with diagnoses of ESRD typically incur higher costs than the average beneficiary, and CMS is making these changes to out-of-pocket maximums to higher reflect beneficiary spending.<p>
