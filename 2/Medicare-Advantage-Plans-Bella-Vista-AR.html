Prior authorization is most frequently required for relatively expensive providers, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B medication, meaning that they're required to attempt some particular medication before they receive approval to strive different medication. In contrast to Medicare Advantage plans, conventional Medicare doesn't usually require prior authorization for services, and doesn't require step remedy for Part B drugs.<p>
