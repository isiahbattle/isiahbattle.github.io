However, UC does require that you simply ship in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your existing retiree plan has a Medicare model or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn sixty five, as soon as Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
