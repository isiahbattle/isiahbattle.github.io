Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays a hundred% of medical services for the remainder of the calendar year. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP restrict doesn't apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant should you did not sign up for Medicare Part B when you had been first eligible.
