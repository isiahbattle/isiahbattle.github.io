<p>Coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace is treated the identical as coverage from any job-based health plan.

<h3>Tips for Choosing the Right Insurance Policy in Highland</h3>
<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium on your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans typically even have larger deductibles, so you must carefully compare these plans along with your revenue earlier than making a decision. Instead of simply responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check the entire Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare device at Medicare.gov/mppf, taking a look at each premiums and total estimated costs for individuals like your self. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay whenever you see the doctor.<p>

<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant when you did not join Medicare Part B whenever you were first eligible.
