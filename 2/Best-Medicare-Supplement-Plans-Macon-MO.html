It is essential to keep in mind that if you are joyful with your Medicare benefits, whether you're in conventional Medicare or an MA plan, you don't HAVE to vary when the opportunity arises. In addition, those with coverage via their current or former employer ought to check to see how any changes may affect such coverage.<p>
