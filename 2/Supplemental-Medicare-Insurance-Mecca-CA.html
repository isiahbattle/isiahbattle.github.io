<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five must discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage through them because the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B.

At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, however might now not qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for more than 8 months.
