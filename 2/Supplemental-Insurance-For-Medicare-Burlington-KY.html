Some recipients will not pay the total $a hundred and forty four.60 commonplace premium due to a "hold innocent" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. The commonplace month-to-month premium for Medicare Part B might be $144.60 for 2020, up $9.10 from $135.50 in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced Friday.<p>

Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays one hundred% of medical companies for the remainder of the calendar yr.
