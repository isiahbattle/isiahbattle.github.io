<p>If you’re covered under a partner’s group health plan at an organization with 20 or extra workers, you do not need to enroll in Medicare at 65. The six months of retroactive benefits applies when you enroll in Medicare after sixty five. At that point it’s computerized and you may’t accept or reject it – it simply happens.
