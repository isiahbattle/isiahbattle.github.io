Sending within the info by this date permits for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days earlier than your 65th birthday, RASC will send you a letter with details about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your partner can maintain off on enrolling in Medicare so long as you’re working — just remember to enroll when you retire.<p>
<p>If you retain the Medicare card, you retain Part B and might want to pay Part B premiums. If you signed up for Medicare through Social Security, then you'll need to contact them to drop Part B coverage. If your Medicare coverage has started and you need to drop Part B, contact Social Security for directions on how to submit a signed request. Your coverage will end the primary day of the month after Social Security gets your request. If you might be beneath 65 and receiving certain disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you may be routinely enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>
